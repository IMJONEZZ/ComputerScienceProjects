### Computer Science Projects

This repository contains a bunch of projects that I did as part of my certification from CodeCademy's Computer Science Career Path. I'm really proud of what I've done, and hope that this can help someone else later.

## Art MarketPlace

veneer.py contains all of the code needed for this project. It simulates an art dealer using Python Classes. It includes classes and methods necessary to add, show, and sell art from and to museums and between private clients.

## Asymptotic Notation

2 Big O notations that interested me: log(N) and sort(N) with example output.

## Data Structures

6 implementations of Data Structures showcasing how they can be used.

# Graph

Includes a small text-based Maze game to showcase a graph data structure. The goal is to get to the treasure room accumulating the smallest cost!

# HashMap

Includes a fun little program in the blossom folder that maps a linked list of flowers to another list of characteristics. Works very similarly to a Python Dictionary or a Javascript Object. WARNING: Does not mean anything, is not verified by experts or anyone of importance!

# Heap

A MinHeap implementation that allows you to time how fast it takes to deal with 1000 responses, both adding and retrieving

# Queue

A Queue implementation that simulates a line at a breakfast deli. Create the deli line with 10 orders, add all the orders to the deli then fulfill them! With some input(), this could be used at an actual deli.

# Stack

A recreation of the famous Towers of Hanoi game. The most annoying version of this game shows up in the famous Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic game. See how high of a stack implementation you can successfully solve! Minimum 3.

# Tree

A tree data structure used for a Create-Your-Own Adventure text game! Currently in an infinite loop stage, but I'm working on it.
TODO: Break out of infinite loop at the end, add more story nodes.

## Recursion
# Recursion
Recursion

A folder that contains both recursive implementations of famous programming problems (like the Fibonacci Sequence and Flattening), but also screenshots of recursive and iterative problems solved side-by-side

## Search

This folder contains implementations of the Manhattan, Dijkstras, and A* Search methods. It also contains SkyRoute, a program that uses a combination of search methods to give the user the shortest route (using the metro) between landmarks in Vancouver, Canada. astar&dijkstrasinmanhattan.py contains a side-by-side comparison of the A* and Dijkstra search algorithms using Manhattan as a testing ground.

## Sorting

Contains implementations of Bubble, Merge, Quicksort, and Radix sorting algorithms.

## Tarot

Not an impressive piece of programming, just something I thought was kind of fun. Uses random, with some list and dictionary methods to play a quick 3-card Tarot. Now just to look up the card meanings...

## Tourism Recommender

Similar to Tarot, this is just a fun collection of functions utilizing nested lists to build a recommender system for tourists. I mean to add more destinations to this to flesh it out some more.

TODO: add more places to go and things to see. Maybe an API?
